# PHAESTUS  
## Brand & Style Guide  
*Forged from the “P” mark*

---

## 1. Brand DNA

PHAESTUS is:
- Engineered, not decorated  
- Industrial, not playful  
- Confident, not loud  

It should feel like it belongs in:
- A lab  
- A datacenter  
- A machine shop  
- A deep-tech startup pitch deck  

Core idea:

> **Precision hardware + intelligent software + mythic gravity**

## 2. Logo System

### Primary Mark
The copper **“P”** with embedded circuit traces is the master symbol.

It represents:
- **Structure** — the machined geometry  
- **Intelligence** — the PCB-like traces  
- **Energy** — copper as heat and conductivity  

### Clear Space
Minimum clear space = width of the vertical stem of the “P”.  
Nothing should intrude inside this zone.

### Backgrounds
Best on:
- Deep charcoal  
- Near-black  
- Very dark blue-grey  

Acceptable on:
- White  
- Very light grey  

Never place on:
- Busy images  
- Bright colors  
- Gradients

## 3. Color System

### Primary Palette

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|------|
| **Forge Copper** | `#C47A4A` | Logo, highlights, key UI accents |
| **Burnt Copper** | `#A9653E` | Darker copper, hover states, depth |
| **Deep Iron** | `#1F242B` | Main backgrounds |
| **Ash Black** | `#121417` | Secondary backgrounds |
| **Steel White** | `#F2F2F2` | Text on dark backgrounds |

Copper is the *heat in the machine*.
Use it sparingly and deliberately.

### Copper Gradient

For large copper surfaces (buttons, cards, panels), use the radial gradient from the logo:

| Position | Color |
|----------|-------|
| **Top-right** | Copper Light `#D4956A` |
| **Top-left, Bottom-left, Bottom-right** | Burnt Copper `#A9653E` |

```css
background: radial-gradient(ellipse at top right, #D4956A 0%, #A9653E 70%);
```

This creates the warm, glowing effect seen in the P mark — as if heat radiates from a single point.

## 4. Typography

### Primary Typeface
**IBM Plex Sans**

Use for:
- Headlines  
- UI  
- Labels  
- Body copy  

Recommended weights:
- **Bold** — headlines  
- **Medium** — navigation, UI  
- **Regular** — body text  
- **Light** — large background text only  

### Optional Monospace
**IBM Plex Mono**

Use for:
- Code  
- Version numbers  
- Diagnostics  
- CLI-style UI  

---

## 5. Layout Rules

PHAESTUS layouts should feel:
- Grid-based  
- Aligned  
- Modular  

Use:
- 8px or 12px spacing grid  
- Hard edges  
- Straight lines  

Avoid:
- Rounded cards  
- Organic layouts  
- Soft blobs  

White space is strength.  
Clutter is weakness.

---

## 6. UI & Graphics Style

### Lines & Shapes
- Sharp  
- Orthogonal  
- Circuit-board inspired  

Avoid:
- Rounded shapes  
- Hand-drawn lines  
- Decorative curves  

### Dividers
Use thin lines in:
- Burnt Copper  
- Dark grey  

Avoid pure white dividers on dark backgrounds.

---

## 7. Iconography

Icons should look like:
- Schematics  
- PCB symbols  
- Industrial control panels  

Rules:
- Consistent line weight  
- Slightly heavier than typical web icons  

Avoid:
- Rounded icons  
- Emoji-like shapes  
- Cartoon styles  

---

## 8. Tone of Voice

PHAESTUS does not sell.  
PHAESTUS **declares**.

Write like:
- An engineer  
- A machine  
- A systems architect  

Short. Precise. Controlled.

Examples:
- “PHAESTUS builds intelligent systems.”  
- “Forged for reliability.”  
- “Designed for complex machines.”  

Never use:
- “We’re excited…”  
- “Our amazing product…”  
- “Disrupting…”  

---

## 9. Tagline Style

Taglines should be:
- Short  
- Industrial  
- Slightly mythic  
- Never marketing fluff  

Examples:
- **Forged Intelligence**  
- **Built From Fire and Code**  
- **Where Machines Think**  
- **Engineering, Refined**  
- **Systems Forged in Copper**  
- **Intelligence, Made Solid**  

---

## 10. Brand Feeling

When someone encounters PHAESTUS, they should think:

> “These people build the systems everything else depends on.”

PHAESTUS should feel:
- Expensive  
- Serious  
- Powerful  
- Calm  

Not:
- Trendy  
- Cute  
- Flashy
